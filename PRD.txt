Product Requirements Document (PRD)

1. Overview

Working title: FilmAgeA mobile‑first web app that lets users discover which actors or actresses were exactly their age when starring in memorable films released 10+ years ago, enhanced with witty, AI‑generated captions.

2. Problem Statement

Movie trivia sites exist, but they focus on raw data. AgeMDB proves there’s delight in age matching, yet its UX is static and its results skew modern. Users crave a more polished, nostalgia‑centric experience that feels personal and share‑worthy.
